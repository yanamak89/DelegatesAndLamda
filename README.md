# Console Application Projects

This repository contains several Console Application projects created using Visual Studio. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts and tasks as described below.

## Task 1

Study the basic constructs and concepts discussed in the lesson.

## Task 2

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template. Create four lambda expressions to perform arithmetic operations: Add (addition), Sub (subtraction), Mul (multiplication), and Div (division). Each lambda expression should take two arguments and return the result of the calculation. The division lambda expression should check for division by zero. Write a program that performs the arithmetic operations specified by the user.

## Task 3

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template. Create an anonymous method that takes an array of delegates as an argument and returns the average value of the values returned by the methods associated with the delegates in the array. The methods associated with the delegates in the array return a random value of type `int`.

## Task 4

Visit the MSDN website. Using MSDN's search mechanisms, independently find a description of each topic covered in the lesson, as outlined below in the "Recommended Resources" section of this lesson description. Save the links and provide a brief description for each.

## Task 5

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template. Create an anonymous method that takes three integer arguments and returns their average.
